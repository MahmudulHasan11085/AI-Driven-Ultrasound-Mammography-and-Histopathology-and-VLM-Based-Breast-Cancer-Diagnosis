# AI-Driven-Ultrasound-Mammography-and-Histopathology-and-VLM-Based-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
This project develops a tri-modality AI-powered breast cancer classification system using
ultrasound, mammogram, and histopathology images. By utilizing ultrasound images alongside
the benefits of multimodal learning, the system aims to reduce the need for unnecessary
biopsies—minimizing costly and invasive procedures. Additionally, it may decrease reliance on
mammogram images, which are limited due to radiation exposure risks during pregnancy, age
restrictions, and limited availability in rural healthcare settings. This reduction can help lower
both financial and emotional burdens on patients. With a user-friendly web interface for
clinicians, the system is intended for large-scale deployment. Guided by the 3L principle—low
cost, low error, and low invasiveness—it is expected to be an efficient, accurate, and
patient-centered solution for breast cancer diagnosis. This project is funded by DBL group, Bangladesh.
